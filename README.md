A semi-analytical detector response generator is comming soon...
You will be able to set
- the detector pitch,
- the detector thickness,
- the detector material (Si, CdTe, Ge),
- the depletion voltage, and
- the electronic noise

and the program will calculate a detector response model,
i.e. the distribution of the measured energy for each initial energy.
